1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans:-
Data Type Boolean contain 2 values ‘True’ and ‘False’.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans: The three basic boolean operators are: AND (All the conditions should satisfied), OR ( either of the condition satisfied), and NOT ( given condition not been satisfied).

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

Ans:
AND:
A	B	Output
1	1	1
1	0	0
0	1	0
0	0	0
OR:
A	B	Output
1	1	1
1	0	1	
0	1	1
0	0	0
NOT:
A	Output
1	0
0	1


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

Ans:
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)  				 # False 0
not (5 > 4)       					 #  False 0
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)				 # True 1
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))				 # False 0
(True and True) and (True == False)		 # False 0
(not False) or (not True)			 # True 1


5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans 
<
>
<=	
>=
!=
==


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.

Ans: 
‘=’   used as assignment operator 
‘==’ used as equal to operator


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Ans 
Correct code is below: # indentation error was there with print line

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')
else:
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

Ans
spam=int(input("Enter value: "))
if spam==1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam==2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?

Ans 
Ctrl+c

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

Ans 
Break will stop the flow of loop once a specified condition is met .
While continue is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop and continue with next iteration.


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

Ans  
range(10)       will start from starting point i.e.0th item and ends with 9th item 
range(0, 10)    will start to count from 0 and end with 9
range(0, 10, 1)  start with 0 , end with 9 increment by 1

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Ans
For loop: 

for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

While loop: 

i=1
while i<11:
    print(i)
    i+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

Ans  
spam.bacon()
